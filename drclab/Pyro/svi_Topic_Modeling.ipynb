    "#### Topic models are a suite of unsupervised learning algorithms that aim to discover and annotate large archives of documents with thematic information. Probabilistic topic models use statistical methods to analyze the words in each text to discover common themes, how those themes are connected to each other, and how they change over time. They enable us to organize and summarize electronic archives at a scale that would be impossible with human annotation alone. The most popular topic model is called latent Dirichlet allocation, or LDA."

    "##### We assume that there is a given number of “topics,” each of which is a probability distributions over words in the vocabulary (far left). Each document is assumed to be generated as follows: i) first, randomly choose a distribution over the topics (the histogram on the right); ii) then, for each word, randomly choose a topic assignment (the colored coins), and randomly choose the word from the corresponding topic. For an in-depth intuitive description, please check the excellent article from David Blei. The goal of topic modeling is to automatically discover the topics from a collection of documents. The documents themselves are observed, while the topic structure — the topics, per-document topic distributions, and the per-document per-word topic assignments — is hidden. The central computational problem for topic modeling is to use the observed documents to infer the hidden topic structure."
